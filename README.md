The LMTC Training Booking App, developed using Flutter for the front end and Firebase for the backend and database management, offers a user-friendly interface for booking trainings tailored to the needs of trainees and institutions alike. Here are some key features of the app:

1. Course Booking: Users can easily browse through existing courses and book their desired training sessions with just a few clicks. Additionally, they have the option to suggest new courses, which LMTC will consider based on popular demand.

2. OTP Verification: To ensure security and authenticity, booking requires a valid mobile number for OTP verification.

3. Admin and Institutional Login: The app offers separate logins for admins and LMTC institutions, allowing for efficient management of courses and bookings.

4. Institutional Management: Institutions can view and manage the list of attendees registered for their trainings. They can also book slots for new attendees directly through the app.

5. Course Management: Only admins have the authority to add or remove courses, ensuring proper management and organization of training offerings.

6. Data Export: Admins have the ability to export details of registered attendees as PDF files for further analysis or record-keeping purposes.

7. Communication: Institutions can add training dates at a later stage, and the app will automatically send corresponding emails or SMS notifications to the registered attendees.
